    <h1>Welcome to the place where I tell you about myself</h1>

    <p>For part two i have added two simple questions. Whats your name? and where do you live? after you anser these questions the comoputer will give you a thirf pop up saying hi your name plus ur borough. I forgot to mention that all of these questions are in the form of pop ups that have a question box at the bottom. That was my small synopsis completed.</p>

  <script>

    var username
      username = prompt("what is your name?")

    var userlocation
      userlocation = prompt("Where do you live?")
     alert("Hi " + username + " from " + userlocation)
  </script>
